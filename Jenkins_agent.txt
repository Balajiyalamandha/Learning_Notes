Yes ✅ — you can run Jenkins on another Windows machine using:

```
http://192.168.0.84:8080/
```

But it depends on what you want:

---

# ✅ Case 1: Access Jenkins UI from another Windows system

If Jenkins is running on **192.168.0.84**, then from another PC on the same network:

1. Open a browser
2. Enter:

```
http://192.168.0.84:8080/
```

If it doesn't open, check:

### 🔹 On the Jenkins machine (192.168.0.84):

* Jenkins service is running
* Windows Firewall allows port **8080**
* You can test by running:

  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 8080
  ```

If firewall is blocking:

* Open **Windows Defender Firewall**
* Add **Inbound Rule**
* Allow TCP port **8080**

# ✅ Case 2: Run Jenkins Agent on another Windows Machine

If you want another Windows system to run builds (agent):

### Step 1: On second Windows machine

* Install Java
* Create folder:

  ```
  C:\Jenkins\workspace
  ```

### Step 2: In Jenkins Master (192.168.0.84)

* Go to:
  **Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → New Node**
* Create node (e.g., `Windows-Agent2`)
* Set:

  * Remote root directory → `C:\Jenkins\workspace`
  * Launch method → Launch agent via WebSocket

### Step 3: On second machine, run:

```bash
java -jar agent.jar -url http://192.168.0.84:8080/ -secret <secret> -name Windows-Agent2 -webSocket -workDir "C:\Jenkins\workspace"
```

If connected successfully, you will see:

```
WebSocket connection open
Connected
```

# 🚨 Important Things to Check

If it doesn’t connect:

### 1️⃣ Same Network?

Both systems must be on same LAN (same WiFi/router).

### 2️⃣ Firewall

On Jenkins machine (192.168.0.84):

* Allow port 8080 in firewall.

### 3️⃣ Jenkins URL Configuration

Go to:

```
Manage Jenkins → Configure System
```

Set Jenkins URL to:

```
http://192.168.0.84:8080/
```

# 🎯 Final Answer

Yes — you can:

* Access Jenkins UI from other Windows systems
* Run builds on other Windows systems as agents
* Run parallel jobs across multiple machines
