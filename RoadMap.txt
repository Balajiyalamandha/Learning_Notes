Got it — you want to move into **Java Test Automation**. With your 4 years of manual testing, this is a very practical path. Here’s a focused, job-oriented guide so you know exactly what to learn and how to practice.

## 🚀 What Is Java Test Automation?

Java Test Automation means using **Java programming + automation tools** to automatically execute test cases instead of running them manually.

**Typical stack in most companies:**

* Java → programming language
* Selenium WebDriver → web automation
* TestNG/JUnit → test framework
* Maven/Gradle → build tool
* Git → version control
* Jenkins → CI/CD

👉 This combination is highly demanded in India.

## 🧱 Skills You Must Learn (In Order)

### ✅ 1. Core Java (Foundation — Mandatory)

Focus only on what automation needs:

**Basics**

* Variables, data types
* Operators
* If–else, loops
* Methods

**OOP (very important for interviews)**

* Class & Object
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction

**Collections (must know)**

* List
* Set
* Map

**Other important**

* Exception handling
* String handling
* File handling (basic)

📌 Goal: Be able to write small Java programs confidently.

---

### ✅ 2. Selenium WebDriver (Core Automation)

You must be comfortable with:

**Locators**

* id
* name
* xpath
* css selector

**WebDriver operations**

* Launch browser
* Click, sendKeys
* Get text
* Navigation

**Handling**

* Dropdown
* Alerts
* Frames
* Multiple windows
* Waits (implicit & explicit)
* Actions class

📌 Goal: Automate login + search flows.

---

### ✅ 3. TestNG Framework

Interviewers expect this.

Learn:

* @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod
* Priorities
* Groups
* Assertions
* Parallel execution
* DataProvider

📌 Goal: Run multiple test cases with reports.

---

### ✅ 4. Build Automation Framework (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is where many candidates fail.

Your framework should include:

* Page Object Model (POM)
* Reusable utilities
* Base class
* TestNG integration
* Maven project
* Extent reports
* Log4j logging
* GitHub repo

🔥 This proves you are automation-ready.

---

### ✅ 5. CI/CD Basics (Nice to Have)

Learn basics of:

* Jenkins job creation
* Git pull from repo
* Maven build execution

---

## 🧪 Sample Java Selenium Code (Simple Login)

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class LoginTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://example.com/login");

        driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("testuser");
        driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys("password");
        driver.findElement(By.id("loginBtn")).click();

        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

✅ You should be able to write this on your own.

## 📅 Suggested 10-Week Plan (For Working Professionals)

**Week 1–3** → Core Java
**Week 4–6** → Selenium
**Week 7–8** → TestNG + POM
**Week 9** → Framework build
**Week 10** → Git + Jenkins + Resume update

---

## 🎯 Realistic Goal for You

With your background:

* After 3 months → Start applying
* After 4–5 months → Crack automation interviews (if practiced well)

---

## ❗ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Learning Java superficially
* ❌ Memorizing XPath without practice
* ❌ Not building framework
* ❌ No GitHub project
* ❌ Only watching YouTube

✅ Daily coding = success
